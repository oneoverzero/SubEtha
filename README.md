# SubEtha

In this, it's first instance, SubEtha is a mere proxy between IRC and a XMPP chat room, to allow the lobsters to talk to each other in a more uniform way, regardless of their communication method of choice.

The current (December 2011) places the lobsters hang out on the virtual landscape are FreeNode's #heartofgold and Jabber's XX chatroom.
